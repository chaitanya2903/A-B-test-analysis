# A/B Test Analysis
### 24 June 2020


## Description
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. I worked on understanding the results of A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
I used Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing to determine which page had more converts. Logistic Regression was used to group the users of each page.
